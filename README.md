# Undo Drawing App
Undo is an Android drawing app made specifically for people with bad eye sight so that is accessible for screen readers.
This project was used to explore Android Studio as well as HCI concepts such as the 10 usablity heurisitics and the gulf of evaluation vs the gulf of execusion. 

## Main Usability Features:
* Alt Text for screen readers, recognizable images to accompany buttons, and high contrast text

* Color wheel that snaps back to the last position it was on when the user's finger moves off the wheel

* Undo and redo features along with an eraser to help correct errors
